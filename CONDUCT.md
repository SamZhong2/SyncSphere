# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment

### Promptness
- All members are expected to arrive on time to meetings.
- Consistent lateness will be addressed individually, and repeated issues may require a team discussion to identify solutions.

### Conversational Courtesies
- Active listening, equal airtime, and respectful dialogue will be actively reinforced.
- Tangents and interruptions will be managed courteously, returning focus to the primary topic.

### Enforcement/Feedback
- Team members will collectively enforce the established rules and standards.
- Feedback will be provided respectfully, privately when appropriate, and constructively, considering each individualâ€™s preferred feedback style.

### 305Soft No Distracted Use of Technology Policy
- All members must adhere to the 305Soft policy prohibiting distracted use of technology (e.g., phones away) during all team meetings.
