# User Retention After Background Color Change

## User Story Number:
User Stories 1, 2, and 4

## Metrics:
- Time spent on app since login/signup
- Retention rate
- Average trend of time spend on app over a period

## Hypothesis:
We believe that changing the background color of the app will increase user retention and time spent on the application. Currently, users may not be finding the app visually engaging enough to remain for longer periods.

The impact of this problem is medium, but with a large user base, the total hours spent on the app could significantly increase if we optimize the visual experience. Users who find the app visually appealing are more likely to return and spend more time using our services.

## Experiment:
We will use Firebase Remote Config to implement this experiment. The test will be conducted on 25% of our user base, randomly selected to ensure statistical significance while minimizing risk.

Setup:
1. Create a Remote Config parameter called "background_color_test" with different color values
2. Set up audience segmentation in Firebase to allocate users to control and test groups
3. Configure Firebase Analytics to track:
   - Session duration
   - Time spent on the home screen
   - Return rate (1-day, 7-day, and 30-day)
   - Number of app opens
   - Time between successive app opens

Firebase events will be triggered when users enter the home screen, tracking the duration until they navigate away or close the app. We'll also implement custom events to track specific interactions on the home screen to determine if certain color schemes encourage more engagement.

## Variations:
We will test three variations against our control:

1. **Control (Current app basics)**: white/pink background to match primary colors of app
2. **Variation A**: #EAEAEA - soft gray backgorund

Each variation will maintain the same layout and functionality, changing only the background color. The home screen will include clear navigation elements and key content sections that remain consistent across all variations.

Implementation will include responsive design considerations to ensure the colors display properly across different devices and screen sizes, maintaining visual consistency and readability of text elements across all background colors.

# Click-Through Rate After Login/Signup UI Redesign

## User Story Number:
User Stories 1, 3, and 5

## Metrics:
- Click-through rate (CTR) from login/signup to home screen
- Bounce rate on login/signup screen
- Time spent before first interaction
- Drop-off rate during signup flow

## Hypothesis:
We believe that redesigning the UI of the login and signup screens will improve the overall click-through rate into the core app experience. Currently, users may be deterred by a lack of visual appeal or unclear call-to-actions, leading to higher bounce rates or abandonment during the login/signup process.

The impact of this problem is high, as it affects the critical entry point into the application. Improving the user interface could lead to more successful conversions from new and returning users, ultimately improving engagement and retention downstream.

## Experiment:
We will use Firebase Remote Config and A/B Testing to implement and monitor this experiment. The test will be run on 25% of users, randomized to ensure even distribution across segments, while maintaining a control group for comparison.

### Setup:
1. Define a Remote Config parameter called `login_ui_version`.
2. Use Firebase A/B Testing to assign users into control and test groups.
3. Configure Firebase Analytics to track:
   - Navigation from login/signup to home screen
   - Bounce events on login/signup screen
   - Time taken before tapping a button or input field
   - Drop-off during multi-step signup (if applicable)

### Tracking Events:
Custom Firebase events will be set up to capture:
- `login_screen_viewed`
- `signup_screen_viewed`
- `login_started`
- `signup_started`
- `login_success`
- `signup_success`
- `home_screen_entered`

## Variations:
We will test three new UI variations against the current design:

1. **Control (Current)**: Existing login/signup layout and styling
2. **Variation A**: Modern minimalist layout with larger CTA buttons, soft gradient background
3. **Variation B**: Split-screen layout with illustration on one side, form on the other
4. **Variation C**: Full-screen video or animation background with simplified input fields and a progress bar during signup

All variations will preserve the same functional logic, security, and required input fields. Changes are strictly visual and UX-oriented, with consistent backend handling across versions.

Responsive design will be ensured for all devices. Accessibility and performance will also be monitored during the test period.

# Calendar Sync Success Rate After UI Enhancement

## User Story Number:
User Stories 3 and 4

## Metrics:

- Successful calendar sync rate
- Time taken to complete sync
- Drop-off rate during sync setup
- User satisfaction score (via post-sync prompt)

## Hypothesis:

We believe that enhancing the UI/UX of the calendar sync process will increase the success rate of syncing multiple calendars and reduce drop-offs. Currently, users may find the sync setup unintuitive or too complex, leading to frustration and abandoned sync attempts.

This problem has a high impact, as the core function of SyncSphere is to allow seamless integration of multiple calendars. If users struggle to complete this setup, they may abandon the app entirely or experience frustration, leading to lower retention and satisfaction.

## Experiment:

We will use Firebase Remote Config and A/B Testing to implement and monitor this experiment. The test will run on 30% of users, randomly assigned to control and test groups to ensure balanced comparison.

### Setup:

- Define a Remote Config parameter called sync_ui_version.
- Assign users into control and test groups using Firebase A/B Testing.
- Configure Firebase Analytics to track:
- Start and completion rates of calendar sync
- Time spent on sync setup screen
- Error messages encountered
- User interaction with help prompts
- Post-sync satisfaction survey responses

### Tracking Events:

Custom Firebase events will be set up to capture:

- sync_setup_started
- sync_setup_completed
- sync_error_encountered
- help_prompt_clicked
- post_sync_feedback_submitted

## Variations:
We will test two new UI variations against the current design:

1. **Control (Current)**: Existing sync setup screen with standard dropdowns and manual entry fields.
2. **Variation A**: Step-by-step guided sync flow with progress indicators, inline help tooltips.
3. **Variation B**: One-click smart sync with auto-detection of linked accounts (e.g., Google, Microsoft, iCloud) and simplified confirmation process.

All variations maintain the same backend sync logic. Changes are focused on UI improvements and user guidance, ensuring clarity and efficiency in the sync process.

Responsive design and accessibility considerations will be included to accommodate various screen sizes and assistive technologies.
