# User Retention After Background Color Change

## User Story Number:
User Stories 1, 2, and 4

## Metrics:
- Time spent on app since login/signup
- Retention rate
- Average trend of time spend on app over a period

## Hypothesis:
We believe that changing the background color of the app will increase user retention and time spent on the application. Currently, users may not be finding the app visually engaging enough to remain for longer periods.

The impact of this problem is medium, but with a large user base, the total hours spent on the app could significantly increase if we optimize the visual experience. Users who find the app visually appealing are more likely to return and spend more time using our services.

## Experiment:
We will use Firebase Remote Config to implement this experiment. The test will be conducted on 25% of our user base, randomly selected to ensure statistical significance while minimizing risk.

Setup:
1. Create a Remote Config parameter called "background_color_test" with different color values
2. Set up audience segmentation in Firebase to allocate users to control and test groups
3. Configure Firebase Analytics to track:
   - Session duration
   - Time spent on the home screen
   - Return rate (1-day, 7-day, and 30-day)
   - Number of app opens
   - Time between successive app opens

Firebase events will be triggered when users enter the home screen, tracking the duration until they navigate away or close the app. We'll also implement custom events to track specific interactions on the home screen to determine if certain color schemes encourage more engagement.

## Variations:
We will test three variations against our control:

1. **Control (Current)**: Standard white/light gray background
2. **Variation A**: Soft blue background (#E6F2FF) - Known for promoting trust and calmness
3. **Variation B**: Light green background (#E8F5E9) - Associated with growth and harmony
4. **Variation C**: Warm beige background (#F5F5DC) - Creates a sense of comfort and familiarity

Each variation will maintain the same layout and functionality, changing only the background color. The home screen will include clear navigation elements and key content sections that remain consistent across all variations.

Implementation will include responsive design considerations to ensure the colors display properly across different devices and screen sizes, maintaining visual consistency and readability of text elements across all background colors.
