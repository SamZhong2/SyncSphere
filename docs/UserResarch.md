### **Observation 1**  
**Observation Statement:**  
- Users want more customizable and context-aware notifications to reduce notification fatigue and improve task management.  

**Supporting Data:**  
- Users express frustration with excessive notifications but still want timely reminders.  
- Some users prefer notifications grouped into daily summaries, while others want instant alerts for urgent tasks.  
- Many users request "snooze" or "remind me later" options to better control when they receive reminders.  

**Team Action (if any):**  
- Implement a **Smart Notifications system** that adapts based on urgency, user behavior, and deadlines.  
- Offer **customizable notification settings**, including frequency, type (push/email), and grouped summaries.  
- Introduce **progressive reminders**, allowing users to snooze or reschedule alerts.  

### **Observation 2:**
**Observation Statement:** 
- Users prefer a more visual and intuitive interface with multiple ways to track and prioritize tasks.

**Supporting Data:**
- Many users mention the need for color coordination to distinguish between task priorities.
- Some users request different task views (calendar, kanban board, list view) based on their workflow.
- Users want dynamic priority ranking and progress tracking to stay on top of deadlines.

**Team Action (if any):** 
- Implement multiple task views (list, kanban, and timeline) for flexibility.
- Introduce priority tagging and visual indicators (e.g., color-coded urgency levels, progress bars).
- Develop a "Focus Mode" that highlights immediate, high-priority tasks while minimizing distractions.
